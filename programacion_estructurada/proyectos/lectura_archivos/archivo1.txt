A verb is one of the main parts of a sentence or question in English.
In fact, you can’t have a sentence or a question without a verb! That’s how important these “action” parts of speech are. 
The verb signals an action, an occurrence, or a state of being. Whether mental, physical, or mechanical, verbs always express activity.
